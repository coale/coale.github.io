                <p class="end">Hello! I have never liked linear paths. Do you know what I really like? Exploring, 
                    going on adventures in pursuit of knowledge, engaging my brain and 
                    losing track of time. So, if reading my CV brings to mind 
                    the question <em>(spoiler alert!)</em> <span>"why should a librarian learn programming and 
                    switch to cybersecurity?"</span>, please come back here and read the first 
                    few lines :) <br>
                    If, on the other hand, the question is <span>"what could she have learned 
                    as a librarian that is also useful in cybersecurity?"</span> you can go 
                    to the <a href="#did">"What I did"</a> section. I had a lot of fun connecting the dots.</p>

                    a computer programming school based on <span>peer-learning</span> and 
                    <span>hands-on projects</span>, without teachers or classes. <br>
                    While collaborating with the other students and exchanging ideas with them, 
                    I accidentally stumbled on <span>cybersecurity</span> and a whole 
                    world opened before my eyes. I started reading about it, then studying 
                    something about it, then devouring entire books, courses and hands-on 
                    practice on websites like <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/atypicalNebu">TryHackMe</a>.
                    I have so much to learn, so why should I stop for eating?

                <h3>What I did</h3>
                <p>I worked as a librarian for about 10 years, in two different 
                    roles: as a reference and a cataloging librarian.
                    For the first 6 years I was a <span>reference librarian</span>, the person
                     who meets the public and answers questions.<br> A popular joke
                      among librarians goes that we’re like Google… but better. 
                      The reality is that we’re very good at using Google and a 
                      lot of other resources to <span>find information</span>.
                    People asked me for all kinds of information: 
                    the precise steps to untangle Italian bureaucracy, 
                    lists of organizations, bibliographies on a wide variety of topics, 
                    checking the reliability of information in their possession, 
                    instructions on how to do something on the computer, 
                    researching books of which they could remember neither 
                    the author nor the title ("But the cover is blue!"), and so on.
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Librarians_like_to-793.2-d81860?style=for-the-badge"/>
                    </figure>
                    <p class="end">
                    Over the last 4 years as a librarian, I then moved to the dark side: 
                <span>cataloging resources</span>. This role has taught me a great deal about 
            <span>organizing information</span> so that it is easily accessible to those seeking it.
                    It was at this stage that I began to explore more technical topics, 
                    such as linked open data applied to library catalogs. And also topics 
                    related to digital libraries.<br>
                    The first step toward transitioning to a more technical career was 
                    "I want to be a digital librarian!". From there to starting coding 
                    took about a month, during which time I was carried away by <span>serendipity</span>. 
                    Serendipity is something I use whenever I want to get out of my 
                    knowledge bubble and it works like a charm.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So why cybersecurity? I have found a field of knowledge that 
                    allows me to play with the <span>ability to look for information</span>, 
                    to use <span>critical thinking</span>, to use my eye for <span>detail</span>, 
                    to look for something that you don't 
                    even know if it is there or not (<span>and that is beyond fun</span>) and to 
                <span>keep learning for the rest of my life</span>. Really? <em>Are you really asking why?</em>
